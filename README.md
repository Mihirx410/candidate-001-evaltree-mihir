# Evaltree Collectibles Frontend

Welcome to the Evaltree technical assessment project! This is a modern, responsive frontend for a digital collectibles platform, built for a Web Developer role.

## 🚀 What is Evaltree?
Evaltree is a platform for issuing, viewing, and (simulated) purchasing limited-edition digital collectibles. The interface is designed to feel upscale, exclusive, and artistic—just like the collectibles themselves.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Vite + React (JavaScript)
- Tailwind CSS (with custom CSS variables)
- Framer Motion (for smooth micro-animations)
- Mock Service Worker (MSW) for all API endpoints
- Google Fonts: Montserrat (headlines), Roboto (body)

## ✨ Features
- **Issue Collectibles:** Create new digital collectibles with a name, description, and edition cap.
- **Marketplace:** View all collectibles and simulate a purchase (with a "Buy Now" button).
- **Raffle Widget:** See your raffle ticket count update after your first purchase.
- **Auto-Enrolment:** Get enrolled in the Evaltree ecosystem after your first purchase or asset creation.
- **My Assets:** See all collectibles you've purchased, in a beautiful card layout.
- **All API calls are mocked**—no backend required!
